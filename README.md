In this small piece of project, I've tried to Clone github's landing page by using CSS and HTML. There are many improvement areas of the work, I think its all about the time that you've to work on this project. Its my first time to use CSS and HTML and a bit complicated for me to work on that area. Honestly, before that small project, I could not imagine myself to create such a page. Now, lets see the domino effect!!
